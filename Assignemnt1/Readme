# Python Programs – Assignment 1

This repository contains Python programs for logic-building practice. Each problem is implemented in a dedicated `.py` file using the naming convention:

- `A1` stands for Assignment 1  
- `Q1`, `Q2`, etc., indicate the question number  

---

## ✅ Coding Standards Followed

- Function-based design for each program  
- Clean and meaningful variable names  
- Input/output is handled properly  
- Each logic is encapsulated in a separate function  
- Code adheres to PEP8 standards for readability
